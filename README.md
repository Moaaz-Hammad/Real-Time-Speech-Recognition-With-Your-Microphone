### 🔧 **Technical Methodology**

#### **1. Audio Capture & Recording** 🎙️
- Uses the `speech_recognition` library to capture audio input.
- Supports real-time recording with visual feedback (widgets for "Record" and "Stop").
- Stores audio files in WAV format for easy processing and storage.

#### **2. Device Configuration** 🎛️
- Leverages `pyaudio` to list available input devices.
- Provides detailed configurations like device name, index, sample rate, and channels.
- Ensures compatibility with diverse hardware setups.

#### **3. Real-Time Speech Recognition** 🧠
- Integrates the **Vosk model** for fast and accurate speech-to-text processing.
- Handles multiple audio frames and processes them incrementally.
- Outputs recognized text dynamically.

#### **4. Error Handling** 🚨
- Implements robust exception handling for recording and recognition processes.
- Prevents crashes and ensures a seamless user experience.
